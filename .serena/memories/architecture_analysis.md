# Architecture Analysis: ocsight vs OpenCode

## Brutal Assessment: Should ocsight reorganize like OpenCode?

**VERDICT: NO. Keep current structure.**

## Why NOT to copy OpenCode's structure

### Different Scale and Scope
- **OpenCode**: 40MB platform with TUI, web interface, cloud components, SDK generation
- **ocsight**: Focused CLI analytics tool for observability
- **OpenCode** needs packages/* for multiple artifacts (CLI, web, cloud, SDKs)  
- **ocsight** ships one CLI binary - packages/ would be architectural masturbation

### Current Structure is Appropriate
```
src/
├── commands/   # CLI handlers - perfect for focused tool
├── lib/        # Core logic - clean separation  
├── mcp/        # MCP server - single responsibility
└── types/      # Type definitions - proper organization
```

### What ocsight Should NEVER Do
- Add packages/ structure (cargo cult programming for single CLI)
- Copy plugin system (.opencode/plugin) - no need for analytics tool
- Add web interface or multiple frontends - scope creep
- Mix Go + TypeScript unnecessarily - current Go wrapper adds complexity

## Minor Improvements Worth Considering
1. **Simplify build process**: Remove Go wrapper complexity
2. **Modern TypeScript config**: Use @tsconfig/node22 baseline
3. **Streamline distribution**: Reduce Homebrew setup complexity
4. **Test organization**: Current structure fine but could be enhanced

## Key Insight
**OpenCode is a platform, ocsight is a focused tool.** Copying their architecture would destroy ocsight's competitive advantage: simplicity, speed, focus.
